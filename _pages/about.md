I am currently a [NIH DSPAN Fellow](https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/training/nih-blueprint-d-span-award-f99k00) and a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Neurosurgery at UCSF working with [Dr. Eddie Chang](https://changlab.ucsf.edu/) and [Dr. Andrew Krystal]. I completed my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Brown University with Dr. David Borton in collaboration with Dr. Sameer Sheth at Baylor College of Medicine. My primary research focus is on understanding network states in psychatric and mood disorders such as Major Depressive Disorder using intracranial recordings and the neural mechanisms of interventional therapies such as deep brain stimulation.
