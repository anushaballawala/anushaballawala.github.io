I am currently a NIH F99 Fellow and a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering working with Dr. David Borton at Brown University and Dr. Sameer Sheth at Baylor College of Medicine. I immigrated to the US from Pakistan for my undergraduate education, which I received from San Jose State University, where I worked with [Dr. Katherine Wilkinson](https://wilkinsonneuro.com/) on characterizing spindle afferent function following inflammation as a McNair Scholar. 

After my undergraduate degree, I worked as a research associate at a neuroscience startup, Circuit Therapeutics, Inc. in Menlo Park, CA under Dr. Nguyen-Vu on optogenetic stimulation of neural circuits in Parkinson's disease, before starting graduate school at Brown as an NSF GRFP fellow. 

My dissertation research is centered on characterizing the neural dynamics associated with cognitive control in treatment-resistant depression, and the effect of deep brain stimulation therapy on cognitive control networks through a multi-institute clinical trial. My long-term career goals are to use cell-type specific tools for neural circuit dissection to better understand and optimize neuromodulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.
