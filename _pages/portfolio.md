## May 2022
I just presented at the SOBP Meeting in New Orleans! Check out the conference proceedings [here](https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(22)00695-3/fulltext). 

## August 2021 
I was awarded the NIH D-SPAN F99/K00 award, co-sponsored by Dr. David Borton and Dr. Sameer Sheth! Read a blurb about me among other Brown awardees [here](https://www.brown.edu/carney/news/2021/10/15/carney-scientists-win-nih-d-span-awards). 

## June 2019 
I'm a big believer in the impact of the CSU education system and the ongoing research there. I talk about my formative experiences in Dr. Wilkinson's lab (along with others) as an undergrad [here](https://blogs.sjsu.edu/wsq/2019/06/03/%E2%80%8Bfinding-ones-way-proprioception-and-biological-research/).
